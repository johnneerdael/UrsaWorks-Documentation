# User Settings

**User Settings** lets you control which config names appear in Rules and Feature Toggle pages.

## Config Visibility

By default, all configs are visible. If you enable filtering, only selected configs appear.

**To configure:**
1. Go to **User Settings**
2. Toggle **Show all configs** on/off for each page
3. Select visible configs
4. Click **Save Settings**

An empty selection with filtering enabled hides all configs.

## Profiles

You can save and load snapshots of your rules and settings as profiles:

- **Save Profile**: Create a named snapshot of current rules + visibility settings
- **Load Profile**: Apply a saved profile to restore rules and settings
- **Share Profile**: Make profiles available to other users (if you have permission)

Shared profiles can be applied by users who share approval group membership with the profile owner.
